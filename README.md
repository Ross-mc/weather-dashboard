# Weather Dashboard

This repository contains a weather dashboard application designed with HTML/CSS with dynamic content created by JavaScript / jQuery.

The application utilises the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Notes

This was an important project for me. I have never been the most creative person and it is something I am working really hard on to improve. I put a lot of work in to the design of the UI/UX of this web application and I am very happy with the results.
